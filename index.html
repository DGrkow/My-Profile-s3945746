        <h2>Personal Information</h2>
        <img src="Profile Pic.jpg" alt="Profile Pic" style="width:250px;height:200px;border:5px solid #555" >
			  <p>My name is Dominic Grkow (s3945746), my email is s3945746@student.rmit.edu.au </p>

        <img src="wellington.jpg" alt="Wellington, New Zealand" style="width:350px;height:210px;float:right;border:5px solid #555">
        <p>I’m originally from “windy” Wellington, New Zealand in which I lived there for seven years, I am also part Irish, Macedonian and Polish. For a drastic change my family and I moved to Poland 17803 km away, in a small town called Czestochowa were I attended primary school which was a culture shock being used to the laid-back New Zealand lifestyle. I become fluent in Polish but quickly forgot it when we situated to Melbourne, Australia. In which I completed my primary school and secondary college education. </p>


        <p>In the free time I enjoy having a hit of tennis which I have been playing for around ten years, in addition, I’ve played Alto Saxophone since I was 12 years old and studied it in my final year of secondary college which was a challenge during lockdown. </p>

        <h2>Interest in Information Technology</h2>
        <p>My interest in IT started in primary school where I would have weekly IT classes and would always look forward to it. I truly settled IT as a career choice in the future in year 10 of secondary college. Seeing lines of code turn into a fully functional program was truly fascinating to me. Currently I’m interested in cyber security and software development as it has many options and pathways to go into in the future and that it’s a growing field to go into as we continually learn new thing to protect and develop different IT systems. So far, I’ve had some experience in IT learning to code in C++ and python as well as using Unity.</p>
        <p>I chose RMIT as it has a very practical way of teaching and that it has many industry connections to come away with a degree that is industry relevant. Another reason was for its global recognition and ranking number one in Australia for Graduate Employment rate which is quite important for me. Also, I liked the location and convenience of the campus being in the middle of the CBD making it easy to travel to and from university. </p>
        <p>In the Introduction to Information Technology course, I expect to learn a large amount of areas within the IT field including security and cloud computing. In addition, I believe it will teach what pathway/job I want to go in and assist me in selecting the right courses in the future to gain the skills I need for the future. But generally, in the Bachelor of Information Technology I expect to learn a wide variety of skills and information that will be vital for my future career such as programming, management and cloud security. </p>

        <h4>Job Description</h4>
        <p>The position at iGreenData as a Developer Programmer includes working on different technologies and designing and implementing different types of ways solving/creating a system for customers. Also, I believe it will involve coding in large scale program in different environment that fit different customer needs. In addition, working for this company is very user centred and will work with different users to find what they need and develop a program that meets their needs.</p>
        <h4>Skills I Have</h4>
        <p>Currently I have a little bit of skill in customer service, and basic IT skills such as programming and an understanding of user needs and how to implement them. Some of the programming languages I have worked with include C++ and python which were learned in high school but are very limited. Overall, I will need to gain experience and skills but most of them will be covered in my degree which will include management, programming, project developing and more.</p>
        <h4>Skills I Need</h4>
        <p>For this position I require at least 5 years’ experience as a Developer Programmer, experience in different programming languages such as Java also, being comfortable in AWS cloud projects, knowledge with different API designs, management skills and have knowledge in cloud platforms including AWS, GCP and AZURE. In addition to these skills I would also have to have some prior experience in management to handle different deadlines and make decisions on the project..</p>
        <h4>Learning Plan</h4>
        <p>Overall, this job is not something that I could acquire straight after I graduate, so I will need to find relevant work experience possibly in Victoria Police as a software developer which is a position that takes graduates. However, a lot of the skills that I need will be developed with my degree including cloud programming, management skills, working in industry relevant projects and learning different programming languages such as Java and python.</p>

        <h2> Personal Profile </h2>
        <h3>Myers Briggs Type Indicator</h3>
        <p>Assertive Consul, 61% Extraverted, 54% Observant, 60% Feeling, 76% Judging, 68% Assertive</p>
        <p>For me these test results show that I work well in groups and that I am highly practical and pragmatic. Also, highlighting that I cooperate with others well, highly organized and thorough at my work making myself resistant to stress and even temper. I feel like these personalities will be vital to work in a team this may make me cooperate with other more and that I will be able to organize and structure a plan that will ensure that we achieve all the necessary outcomes for the project. This test should make me choose people who are organized and people who enjoy working in a team making it easier to collaborate with each other and share our ideas. </p>
        <h3>Learning Style</h3>
        <p>My learning style is visual, which highlights that I learn best by reading and seeing pictures. This may make me more likely to use text or pictures when sharing info to my group. This is good to know when choosing my group so that I can choose people that have a similar learning approach and that we can together more collaboratively and share our learning tips throughout the assignment thus making our time working together more efficient.</p>
        <h3>Leadership Style</h3>
        <p>My leadership style is transformative, this means that I want to gain knowledge, make big risks, rarely need to be the centre of attention, and prefer to share the success with everyone. This makes me more of a team player, shows that I will listen to everybody’s information and there project ideas. It will be good to take this test into account when deciding to form a team as it will make me form a group that has a similar leadership style; someone who is open to listen to others and an individual who enjoys working in a group rather than working individually. </p>

        <h2>Project Idea</h2>
        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>For my project idea I’ve always been intrigued with Virtual Reality and ways that we can use it to assist people in their education experience. Thus, my project idea would be a Virtual Reality program that would allow users who are unable to attend on-campus to be able to view there lectures via VR. It would involve interactive activities, which would include quizzes, polls, and discussions as well as a live chat feature to allow direct communication with their peers and lecturer. I believe this would help people who are online be able to have a more hands on/practical experience, resulting in more engagement from the user, possibly assisting them in their studies. In addition, it will assist students who are more hands on learners to gain the learning experience they require. Overall, this project idea will assist in the education of users who are unable to attend on-campus lectures.</p>
        <h3>My Motivation</h3>
        <p>This project idea will be very useful in assisting students who can’t attend on-campus lectures. It will create a more interactive experience resulting in an increase of engagement levels from students. In addition, similar technology is being used already in the Stanford School of Business and the University of British Colombia Law School. Also, this technology is changing the way we deliver education, rather than sitting in a lecture it can be done all at home with the same high level education experience being provided. Thus, for students who are mostly learning only it provides them a way to have a collaborative experience rather than watching a recorded lecture that has little to no interactions. </p>
        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Within this product it will include many features including interactive quiz’s, pre-recorded lecture, a virtual environment (a lecture hall) and a live-chat with other students and the lecturer allowing for an interactive experience.</p>
        <p>The interactive quiz will be implemented as a pop up display that the user will be able to view. Firstly, the pop up display needs to be prominent enough for the user to notice it and have all the relevant questions needed. To ensure that all the relevant questions are there the lecturer will be able to input questions before the lecture so that it allows the user to reflect on the information learnt throughout the lecture they are watching. It will require the user to input an answer most likely a multiple choice selection. The input will most likely be inputted through a keyboard (however using a keyboard may be difficult especially as the user won’t be able to see their keyboard) or motion controllers, by hovering over the choices and selecting one. The program will take the user’s input and determine whether the user’s input was correct or incorrect, then the program will output there results. </p>
        <p>The pre-recorded lecture will have to be uploaded by the lecturer into the system beforehand. This will then be implemented into the product so that the user is able to watch it in the virtual environment, most likely on a virtual screen. To allow the lecturer to input a pre-recorded lecture into the virtual environment the product will have to include a graphical interface that allows to access files specified by the lecturer to be uploaded, this graphical interface would also have features to input power point slides and different learning materials so the students can have access to them during the lecture. Another feature would include an option to have the lecture live-stream directly into the virtual environment, this will allow the user to discuss relevant topics live. The live-streaming function would be directly linked with the live-chat feature where the lecturer and students would be able to cover and discuss different information and topics.</p>
        <p>Live-chat with other students and the lecturer, this feature will be included within the product to allow the user to clarify different content that was covered within a lecture, or ask questions on a particular topic. This would be linked to a service such as collaborate ultra that will allow the user to input a message through the chat function or speak directly through there microphone. Other services that will assist in this feature would include in-built packages within unity that will allow for live video and chat within the product. Also, this live-chat feature could also be implemented into smaller group sessions such as working on assignments or presenting to a class, which will develop collaborative and communication skills.</p>
        <p>A virtual environment will need to be created as a part of this product. It will allow the user to have an immersive experience and have an experience of being in a lecture hall. In addition, this virtual environment would include many different features as discussed earlier including the lecture and the quiz. Creating the virtual environment through software such as unity would require building and designing different objects to create the desired environment, in addition to objects it will require lighting and different textures to be implemented onto the different objects. </p>
        <h3>Tools and Technologies Required</h3>
        <p>The tools and technology that I require includes Unity, a VR headset and sensors.  Unity is free software that is used to create and design games/digital environments such as a VR lecture. Unity has many add-ons to assist in making a VR program; this includes a live chat feature and specific types of objects. The VR headset would be required to use the VR program in addition to the headset motion controllers will be required to interact with the program which includes participating in the in-built quizzes, the sensors would be necessary to track the user’s motion in their own environment such as their bedroom.</p>
        <p>If I was going to make a VR headset for this product, it would include different components such as the shell of the headset, using a 3D printer to build it. The shell would be used to house all the components; some of the components would include an Arduino Due, LCD screen, accelerometer, magnetometers and a gyroscope. The Arduino due allows for control of the computer system acts as a mini computer which controls the functions within the system. The LCD screen would be within the shell of the headset used to display the program. The accelerometer would be used for rotational tracking knowing which way is up, magnetometers is used to track/detect movement and speed and a gyroscope would have to be implemented to detect the tilt of the device.</p>
        <h3>Skills Required</h3>
        <p>The skills required would include having knowledge of how to use Unity and program in C#. Unity will not be too difficult for me to use, especially as I’ve worked with it before and know how to develop and design a game/program within it. But, I still need to work on the more advanced features on Unity such as making the motion controllers work and interact with the program. This will require me at looking for different resources on the internet such as free courses to gain the skills I require to implement all the features that will be within this VR product. Also, C# would require further knowledge as I have little to no experience in this programming language. This would include watching multiple videos on how to program in C#; also I would require to do research on how to program a VR program in unity and how to implement all the features such as live chat. But this information is readily available on the internet for free, thus it would only require time. Overall, the skills required are easy to obtain and would be able to learn them in a small timeframe. </p>
        <h3>Outcome</h3>
        <p>If the project is successful, it will allow people who don’t access to attend on-campus lectures/classes to have this resource to have a more immersive and enjoyable experience. This product will allow for more interaction with other students and their lectures allowing them to ask any questions or clarify a topic throughout their sessions. This higher level of engagement from the student will allow them to gain valued skills such as communication and collaboration vital for their future work after their studies. In addition, with the instant feed-back from the quizzes they complete it will allow them to get a gauge on how they’re progressing through the topic and whether they need to revise. Overall, this product will have a positive impact on students learning experience and on the future skills they will require.</p>
